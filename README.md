PROJECT DESCRIPTON : 
This is my university project which I made as a semester project in 8th semester for web programming course. This project is basically have sign up and log in options for customers. New customers who visit my website will sign up and open an account to visit the order website. And old customers can visit the website by logging in. There will be a page called menu where customers can search by typing the name of the food. And on that page, the images of all the foods that are available on my website will be set, if you click on the images, you will go to the menu page of those foods. Where the name and price of each food will be mentioned. On clicking on that food, another page will open where the details of the food will be given and the customer will select the quantity of food from there and click on the order now button,the order will be confirmed.Here is an contact us option on my website so that the customer can contact the admin if they face any problem.
